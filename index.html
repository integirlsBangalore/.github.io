                <h2>Our Mission</h2>
                <p>We work to create a safe, empowering space for girls and non-binary students in India to explore mathematics confidently.
We recognize how gender bias and systemic barriers affect access to STEM for many students, especially Non Binary youth. Our goal is to support
young learners early—helping them discover joy in problem solving, grow into competitive thinkers, explore STEM pathways, and gain access
to opportunities including olympiads, mentorship, and international programs.</p>

                            Of course, you should really attend this competition. In the past, many people have stated that INTEGIRLS gave them an entry into math competitions and they had no idea how it was until they attended the event. If you would like any pointers to understand how to prepare, you can feel free to email us. Hope to see you at our event(s).
